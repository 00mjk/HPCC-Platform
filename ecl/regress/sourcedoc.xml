    <para>
The ecl/regress directory contains the sources for the compiler regression suite.  This regression suite is used to
check any changes to the eclcc compiler.  The recommended approach is

a) Run the regression suite and save the generated output.
b) Make the changes to the source code.
c) Re run the regression suite, compare the generated code, and check that all the changes are expected.

The regression suite should contain at least one example of any language feature that is added to the system.





To run the regression suite under windows:
a) Ensure path to eclcc is set up correctly
b) Copy setreg.bat.sample to setreg.bat and modify the contents to reflect your set up.
c) Copy rcompare.bat.sample to rcompare.bat and update to reflect your comparison program.

r1.bat.sample can be used to run the regression test for a single file.
E.g.,
r1 dataset.ecl

rall.bat runs the full regression test
